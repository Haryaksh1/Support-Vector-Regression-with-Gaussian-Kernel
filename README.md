# Support-Vector-Regression-with-Gaussian-Kernel
This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a Gaussian (RBF) kernel for advanced regression tasks. The project demonstrates robust handling of non-linear relationships and strong generalization to unseen data, using systematic hyperparameter optimization and rigorous model evaluation.
##Overview
- Model: Support Vector Regression (SVR) with Gaussian (RBF) kernel

- Goal: Predict a continuous target variable from multiple input features using a model that balances accuracy and generalization

- Key Features:

- Handles non-linear relationships between features and target

- Robust to outliers

- Systematic hyperparameter search (grid search with cross-validation)

- Clear visualizations of model fit and parameter optimization

##Dataset
File: Supervised-modeling-data-Sheet1.csv

Description: Contains 1000 observations, each with 8 input features (x1â€“x8) and 1 continuous target variable (y)

Features: Represent various process or system parameters with different scales and ranges

Target: A continuous outcome variable to be predicted
